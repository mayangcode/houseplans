              <p><strong>132 Cool House Designs Conan Exiles</strong>. Perhaps it is more complicated to defend than the previous ones that we have already taught you, but it is very good disposition and it is very safe. Slavers row which is the torturers worktable and wop&#039;s, the high temple which is where our mitra shrine is (other religions are studied offsite.) and then the storehouse (which is relatively central and houses bulk storage.) This recommendation is very interesting, since it will take you to build your base in conan exiles at the edge of the map. But i&#039;m never discouraged (for too long) as failure is the best way to learn and improve. I will show you some things that i have picked up along the way while building my current base in the single player game. This guide is intended to help you with building your base with strong buildings.</p>
